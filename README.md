# Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps) Specialization

These are my personal notes of the [Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/large-language-model-operations) from Coursera.

The specialization is composed by 6 courses:

1. Introduction to Generative AI
2. [Operationalizing LLMs on Azure](./02_Azure_LLMs/)
3. Advanced Data Engineering
4. GenAI and LLMs on AWS
5. Databricks to Local LLMs
6. Open Source LLMOps Solutions

**Each course has a dedicated folder which contains a `README.md` with a guide and all necessary files in it**. Several topics are not new to me, so I have not been very detailed in parts that I am familiar with; additionally, I have completed only the courses I am interested in.
